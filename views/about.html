            <p class="about">SmartHome is an dynamic web application that allows users to 
                interact with the dashboard and connect with their devices at home. 
                It allows users to add devices from a pre-defined list of devices, 
                name them as per their preference, and control the device remotely through the web application.
                <br><br>
                Users are able to check the status of the devices at home such as:
                <br> cooling and heating systems, 
                curtains and blinds, lighting, security, audio- visual systems such as TV, radio, music players, 
                kitchen appliances such as fridge-freezer, hob, oven, microwave, etc. 
                <br><br>
                Then the system lets the customers control the devices by changing the status such as turning on or off, 
                opening/closing, increasing/decreasing volumes, temperature, and so on. 
                The user can also add information related to their smart home and store it in the database.</p>
