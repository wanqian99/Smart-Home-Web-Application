# Smart-Home-Web-Application

In the project, I developed dynamic web application including routes, forms, and database access that functions as a dashboard to help customers control devices in their smart home. Essentially the dynamic web application interacts with users to provide information related to the status of devices at home such as cooling and heating systems, curtains and blinds, lighting, security, audio- visual systems such as TV, radio, music players, kitchen appliances such as fridge-freezer, hob, oven, microwave, etc.
