# Smart-Home-Web-Application
SmartHome is an dynamic web application that allows users to interact with the dashboard and connect with their devices at home. It allows users to add devices from a pre-defined list of devices, name them as per their preference, and control the device remotely through the web application. 

Users are able to check the status of the devices at home such as: 
cooling and heating systems, curtains and blinds, lighting, security, audio- visual systems such as TV, radio, music players, kitchen appliances such as fridge-freezer, hob, oven, microwave, etc. 

The system allows customers control over the devices by changing the status such as turning on or off, opening/closing, increasing/decreasing volumes, temperature, and so on. The user can also add information related to their smart home and store it in the database.

### How to run:
1) mysql -> CREATE DATABASE Devices;
